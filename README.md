# PHP_APIs
A simple sample of PHP Apis to create, read one, update and read all records from a database.

There are three folders as follows:
  -- config
      core.php
      database.php
  -- objects
      project.php
  -- project
      create.php
      read_one.php
      read.php
      update.php
      
    
 You need to create a simple database with the following:
    database name = "projects_api"                 // this could be changed and modified-- new name to be changed in /config/database.php
 and a table with a name = "projects".             // this could also be changed and new replaced in /objects/projects.php
 
 
 The table will have 6 fields:   id, name, description, author, country and date_created.
 
 
 You can test these using POSTMAN.
